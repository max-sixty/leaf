/* lf-diff: upgraded because it parses. The body is a unified diff (data, not
 * prose), rendered as one <details> per file — native disclosure — with add/del
 * tints and per-file +/− counts. The evidence rule mechanized for code changes:
 * paste the real diff instead of paraphrasing it.
 *
 * Syntax colour rides on top, from each file's own path (langForPath): the tints
 * are the widget's statement about a line and the token colours are the file's
 * about its words, and they are a background and an ink, so neither is spending
 * the other's channel. A diff sits beside lf-code on the pages that carry both —
 * pr-walkthrough shows the same four lines twice — and leaving one plain says the
 * evidence is not code.
 *
 * What gets tokenized is a hunk, one side at a time, with the +/−/space column
 * cut off. Each of those is load-bearing; see colorHunks. */

// has no opener to close, so its closing `"""` opens a string that eats the rest — to
// the hunk it happened in.
//
// Each side, separately. A hunk interleaves two versions, so read straight through it
// the deleted `if x:` and the added `if x is None:` are consecutive. The old side is
// ctx+del and the new side ctx+add; each is a version of the file that really existed.
// A context line is written twice and the new side lands last, because the new side is
// the text the user is being asked to approve.

// marker red and the addition marker blue — the widget's own signal, restated wrong.
