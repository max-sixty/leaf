/* cq-milestone: upgraded because its chip row (`when` plus each `tags` entry)
 * outruns CSS's two pseudo-elements. The upgrade only inserts a built chip row
 * after the leading <strong>; authored text is preserved verbatim — an error
 * here surfaces on the console and leaves the prose untouched, so there is no
 * failSoft (which replaces content, the data-widget degradation). The rail and
 * status dot are theme CSS.
 *
 * The chips are real text for the same reason every x-says attribute is: the
 * user has to be able to select and quote a word the page says. They aren't
 * x-says because that pass renders one run of words at an edge a pseudo-element
 * could have reached, while this row is a list placed after the title — which is
 * the line past which a widget needs a module of its own. */
