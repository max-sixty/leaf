"""Serve and mediate an interactive leaf page.

A `uv` script: the PEP 723 header above declares the dependencies and
`interact.py.lock` beside it pins them, so every install runs the same versions;
editing the header re-resolves the lock on the next run. `uv` is the one
prerequisite for the whole plugin — no venv to create, no build step.
Run it with `uv run interact.py <group> <command> …`, or as
`leaf <group> <command> …` through the plugin's `bin/leaf` launcher.
Claude Code puts that launcher on PATH; Codex resolves it from the active skill.

A page directory holds:
    versions/v1.html…    immutable page versions (the agent writes them). The server
                         exposes a version only once `version publish` lands its
                         note, after `version check` passes, so a half-written or
                         broken file is never live to an open browser.
    leaf.js          the runtime (widget layer + comment layer), served at /leaf.js
    theme.css            tokens, element styles, class idioms, element-widget CSS
    registry.json        the widget vocabulary: JSON Schema per lf-* tag, plus the
                         layer-wide facts under $ — $idioms, $languages, and the page's
                         vocabulary stamp ($events, x-state): the one statement of what
                         this page's vendored runtime speaks
    icon.svg             the mark the tab wears, whose lf-tone element the runtime
                         paints in whatever colour the banner's dot is wearing — so a
                         reader with six leaves open sees which one wants them
                         without opening any
    widgets/             one ES module per upgraded widget (lf-tabs.js, lf-diagram.js)
    vendor/              vendored third-party assets (mermaid.min.js, sortable.esm.js)
    media/               images the page shows, each named by the hash of its bytes
                         (`page media`). Not vendored — this is the page's content,
                         not the layer's — but served the same way, and
                         content-addressing is what lets content live here at all: a
                         name means one set of bytes forever, so a version the
                         user approved cannot show them different pixels later,
                         and two versions showing the same screenshot share the one
                         file rather than a copy each. It is also the only door an
                         image has: the page's author is a language model, and a
                         screenshot is a megabyte of base64 it cannot type — nor
                         should each version carry a copy of one that `version check`
                         walks and a browser reloads. The transport was never an
                         optimisation over inlining; inlining was never available
    comments.jsonl       append-only event log; an event's seq is its line number (1-based)
    status.json          the agent's declared state: {"state": working|waiting|idle, "detail", "ts"};
                         detail is the finer grain the banner reads out after the
                         state — what the agent is doing while working, what it
                         needs from the reader while waiting;
                         when `leaf wait` prints for a non-working page, it
                         writes working with "handoff": true until the agent's
                         own `leaf status` lands
    heartbeat.json       watcher liveness, bumped by `leaf wait` while it runs
    viewed.json          when a browser last polled the page, bumped (throttled)
                         by the server on /api/state; absent for a page nobody
                         has ever opened, which would otherwise be
                         indistinguishable from one the user studied and left
    cursor.json          seq of the last user event acknowledged from the agent's
                         model context, written by `leaf ack`
    server.json          {"port", "pid", "url"} for the running server, held
                         open under an exclusive lock for that process's life:
                         the lock is the claim (whoever takes it serves the
                         page) and the liveness at once, so a record whose
                         writer is gone — crashed, killed, or lost to a
                         reboot — is free for the taking and reads as stale
    access.json          {"host", "bind", "port", "lifetime"}: the name the page's
                         URL carries, the interface its server binds, the exact
                         port, and what may take the server down. Derived at the
                         first `server run` and kept, because a restart has to
                         reproduce the URL an open browser is already polling —
                         the port included, since a revive on the next free port
                         reports success while the open tab polls the old one.
                         lifetime is "session" when the first serve claimed the
                         page and "standing" when nothing did (or --standing
                         declined to); it survives revives, and `server stop`
                         clears it so the next serve decides afresh. The key the
                         URL also carries is the machine's, not the page's, and
                         lives in the state home
    session.json         {"id", "host", "pid", "agent", "cwd"} of the agent
                         session last working on the page — the watcher the
                         banner names, not necessarily the author of any given
                         message, and the directory it was working in, which is
                         what the leaves board tells one page from another by

status.json is a claim, and a claim never expires on its own: an agent that
stopped watching renders exactly like one that is watching and has nothing to
say, so a comment can sit unread with the page still reading "Claude is
working". The directory therefore also carries what it can prove — a heartbeat
only a live `leaf wait` bumps, the acknowledgement cursor, and the owning
session's pid — and `/api/state` ships those beside the claim, so the banner can
say when the claim has outlived them. When a wait prints for a non-working page, it
marks the status it writes "handoff", which dates it: after acknowledgement the agent
writes its own `leaf status`, so the mark surviving is a dropped pickup rather than a
long turn, and the banner gives it a much shorter rope. Wait output that lands
while the agent is already working leaves that claim untouched; there is no pickup
gap to date.

Where nothing answers for the claim at all, the banner drops it rather than
repeating it: a claimant pid that has exited settles the question outright, and a
page nothing ever claimed has only the claim's own age to go on, so it falls to
the same grace. Either way the page is unheld, and the banner says that instead —
"no session holds this page" is a fact it computed, where "Claude is working"
would be a fortnight-old sentence someone else wrote. It is also not a fault: a
page that stands for weeks (below) spends most of its life unheld, and picks up
again the moment a session does.

The `hook` command closes the same gap from the agent's side. Registered on
Stop, UserPromptSubmit and SessionEnd, it refuses to let a turn end with one of
this session's pages unwatched, surfaces unacknowledged user events at the next
prompt, and idles the pages and stops their servers when the session exits. It
finds them through ~/.local/state/leaf/sessions/<session id>.json, which
`server run` and `leaf wait` write the host session identity supplied by the
launcher — absent that (interact.py run outside an agent host), nothing is claimed
and the hooks stand down. Unacknowledged events are the one thing
`leaf status <page> idle` can't close over: idling is how a leaf ends,
and one can't end on comments nobody read.

Whether a session's end reaches a server is decided once, by the launch, and
written down in server.json as its lifetime. `server run` from an agent host
claims the page, and that claim is what two reapers act on: a watcher thread
stops the process when the claimant pid goes, and SessionEnd idles the page and
stops the server. `server run` from a bare shell — a terminal, a launchd job —
claims nothing, and that is the standing serve: a page kept up across sessions,
for a command hub or a dashboard someone leaves open for weeks.
`server run --standing` makes the same statement from inside a host: the launch
declines the claim, for a page meant to outlive the session that starts it —
under a harness that restarts mid-session the claimant pid churns, and a claimed
server reads the old pid's death as the session ending. No daemon is
involved and nothing revives it; `leaf server stop` is its one reaper, which
is the whole of what "standing" means. A session that picks the page up later
owes it a watcher while it lives, exactly as it would any page, and takes
nothing down when it ends: no watcher was ever started for a server it didn't
launch, and SessionEnd leaves a standing one alone rather than adopting it —
including the page's status, since the leaf outlives the session that
answered on it for an afternoon.

`page init` vendors the runtime, theme, registry, widgets, and vendor assets into the
page directory, overlaying by precedence: leaf's integrated layer (the runtime,
the theme's own rules, the suggestion family and the $ keys), then its bundled
widgets (the content families, an overlay like any other so they reach a page
through the same door a project's widgets do), then the user layer
(~/.config/leaf/), then the project layer
(./.leaf/). Theme stylesheets concatenate in that order, so a layer
can override one token or rule without copying the defaults. Registry entries
merge by top-level name, with a later layer replacing one complete entry rather
than deep-merging its schema; runtime, widget, and vendor files replace by path.
The page directory itself lives wherever the caller says —
conventionally ~/.local/state/leaf/pages/<slug>/ — and is self-contained,
so an approved version can't change under its user; re-running `page init`
is the explicit re-vendor, noted in the next version's changelog.

The registry is shared by the JS runtime, the POST and re-vendor action gates,
this file's `version check` and thread-markup validation, the passage reader
`leaf comment` anchors through, and the `page catalog` the agent reads. Each
entry is JSON Schema over the instance built from the element's attributes
(values as strings, flag attributes as True). What JSON Schema has no
vocabulary for rides in the custom keywords below:
    x-parent    the tags this element may be a direct child of
    x-content   the content model: "prose" (flow content, widgets welcome),
                "items" (element children only, no loose text), "data" (one <pre>
                holding text in the notation the description names), "none"
                (empty). <pre> because a data body's whitespace is load-bearing
                and that tag is HTML's only way to say so — otherwise it is a CSS
                fact, and a tool reading the markup alone collapses what it
                cannot see the rule for.
                Children that name this tag in x-parent are admissible under
                any model — that is what x-parent means. A list because one
                element can belong to two holders: a chip is written in a
                lf-option and in a lf-variant, which are the same shape either
                side of the decision.
    x-inline    true when the element is set among the words around it rather
                than laid out as a region of its own. The render gate floors a
                widget's box to catch one that upgraded into nothing, and an
                inline element's box is the words in it: so it keeps the height
                floor and takes no width floor at all, a chip reading `£9` being
                31px wide and correct. Declared rather than read off the
                rendered display, which answers "inline" for a widget whose
                theme rule went missing too.
    x-says      attributes whose values are words the reader sees, mapped to the
                edge they render at ("before" = first child, "after" = last).
                The runtime renders them as real text there, because a user
                can only quote what a text node holds — the theme's matching
                `content: attr()` is the same words for a page with no script.
    x-paints    attributes whose value the theme renders as paint and no words — a
                task's status marker, an event's kind, the ring on a recommended
                option. The runtime speaks each as a word clipped to nothing
                (renderQuiet), the value itself or, for a flag attribute carrying
                none, the attribute's own name. Declared per attribute rather than
                taken for every painted one, because paint that merely emphasises
                the words beside it — a chip's tone — would be the same fact said
                twice to whoever is listening.
                What it cannot reach is a painted fact whose meaning is computed
                rather than stated: lf-metric's `direction` means better or worse
                only crossed with the sign of `delta`, and "up-good" said aloud is
                nothing. Declaring that would be a rule in the registry rather than
                a name, and buying it with a module would cost lf-metric more than
                it bought — an upgraded element with no x-verbatim is opaque to
                quoting, so the caption would stop being something the reader can
                point at to gain a word they can already infer from the number.
    x-refers    attributes whose values name another element on the page. The
                reader follows one, so `version check` holds each to an id the
                version actually carries; a reply's fragment is exempt, having no
                page to check against.
    x-tone      the attribute whose value names one of $tones.names, the semantic
                tints the theme paints. Declared rather than known by tag, so a
                second widget taking a tone costs a line and no new reader — and
                the list lives with the layer, since the palette is the page's
                rather than any one widget's.
    x-language  the attribute whose value names a code language. The layer colors
                what $languages.names holds, so a widget taking one declares which
                attribute carries it and `version check` validates every such
                attribute against that list — the same list a plain <pre><code
                class="language-*"> is held to.
    x-lines     attributes holding 1-based line references into the nearest data
                body — the element's own <pre>, or its holder's (lf-note's `at`
                names a line of its lf-code). `version check` refuses a reference
                outside the body or a range running backwards (line_ref_errors);
                the modules render the miss silently, which is why the door owns it.
    x-upgrade   true when the runtime imports /widgets/<tag>.js for it
    x-verbatim  true when an upgraded element's body reaches the reader as its own
                words. Otherwise a module may render anything in place of them, so
                `leaf comment` treats the element as opaque and won't quote
                through it.
    x-shadow    true when the module renders the page's words into a shadow root.
                The passage walk, the selection capture and the id lookups cross
                exactly the declared roots — an undeclared root's words are
                invisible to every one of them, so a widget that attaches one
                declares it or its quotes anchor beside the reader's selection.
    x-exhibit   true when everything inside this element is quoted material — a
                specimen, not the page speaking. Interactive widgets inside take
                no input: modules consult `quoted()` before wiring affordances,
                and the action door refuses a send from one regardless.
    x-visual    true when the element renders as a picture: a click anchors on
                the element whole, there being no text in it to select — the
                same anchor a click on an <svg> or <img> makes.
    x-wide      the width model, for evidence set to its content rather than to
                the measure prose is read at: "box" (the widget lays its
                content out into whatever width it is given, a board's columns,
                so it stands at the one width the whole vocabulary shares),
                "drawing" (the widget renders one thing drawn at a size of its
                own, a diagram's graph, so its box is the clip around it — the
                room the page has, with the drawing as near the column's axis
                as the claimed margins allow, and scrolling where even the room
                is short). The runtime marks what this declares and theme.css
                spends the room the layout measured, so a page's shape follows
                what it holds and no page states a width.
    x-state     the widget's action verbs: each verb's detail schema, its fold
                unit, and the record form its state takes in markup. Every
                applyAction is absolute, so the user's standing state is a
                fold — the last surviving action per unit — and one declaration
                drives the POST and re-vendor contract gates, check's state gate,
                the record-lag report, the runtime's pending mark, and the diff's
                state half (see $state in the registry).
    x-report    the widget's agent channel: report verbs a worker folds onto the
                page through `leaf report`, each with a detail schema, fold
                unit, and *required* record form — declared state only, never
                body words, so the passage reading is untouched by one. The
                precedence is opposite to x-state's: an action outranks every
                later version until `restated` retracts it, while a report is
                provisional and stands only until a version answers it by id —
                `reports` on the note, written by `version publish`; `overruled`
                on the element is how a version keeps its own state over one.
                See $report in the registry.
    x-retired-when  the outcome under which this element leaves the page: the
                slot a decision retires, and x-parent the widgets whose decision
                reaches it. That one relation is the whole of what a decision
                settles — the anchor pass's skip list on both sides, and which
                ids a version honoring the decision may drop (retirable_ids).
    x-withdrawn-as  the outcome an unanswered instance stands as when the author
                takes it back: a withdrawn suggestion leaves the page where a
                `reject` would. Without it a question, once asked, stays until
                the reader answers it — nothing else says which slots were the
                author's to take back and which hold the page's own words.
    x-awaits    an instance of this tag is a standing request to the reader:
                `when` says which instances ask (attribute values, a flag's
                being true and false), `all` names the verb one press answers
                every one with. What counts as answered is no new bookkeeping —
                a verb recording as an attribute answers on the record the
                replayed page carries, and every other verb, whatever else it
                records, through its own surviving fold entry — so the banner's
                count, the key that steps them and the `?` overlay read one list
                (see $awaits).
    x-example   one authored example, printed by `page catalog`

Event kinds: comment (optional anchor {section, quote, and the neighbouring
text as prefix/suffix where there is any, which is what tells two identical
passages apart), reply (parent=id),
resolve (parent=id), done (user sign-off; the banner offers it, and this door
takes it, only on a page declaring <meta name="lf-review" content="sign-off"> —
approval is the page's ask, and a page that asks nothing gets no terminal
control at all), action (user; a widget reporting the
user editing the document through it — widget=element id, action=verb, detail
per widget, version the edit was made against), report (agent; a worker's
provisional state change on a page widget — same widget/action/detail/version
shape as an action, validated by the widget's x-report declaration at the
`leaf report` door, and standing only until a version answers it), note
(agent; per-version changelog, carrying `restated`: the element ids whose
decisions the publishing version took back, and `reports`: the report event ids
the version absorbed or overruled), error (the page's own runtime reporting a
failure in front of the user — author=page, heard by the watcher like a report
and never counted against the reader). The server stamps every other
browser-posted event author=user; agent-side `leaf comment`, `leaf reply`, `leaf report`,
and `version publish` stamp the wire
role author=claude plus the posting session's own voice: `agent`, its display name,
and `session`, its host session id. Several agent sessions can write to one page,
so the voice is read from the poster's environment rather than from session.json,
which names only the watcher — and identity is the session id, because a display
name is anyone's to choose and two workers may share one.
A message body is Markdown, stored as typed and
rendered by the page's own vendored runtime — the browser is where the page's other
rendering already lives, and vendoring the renderer beside the panel's styles is what
keeps the two versioning together. A fragment link in a body — `[the group](#d-channel)`,
either author's — points at an element of the page, and the browser's own navigation
carries the reader there, opening whatever tab or settled group hides it. Two things are
the runtime's: an arrival aimed by such a link (⌘-click opens a tab the browser answers
before any widget has upgraded), and marking one this version can't follow, since a
message outlives the version it was written on. Raw HTML in a body renders as its characters there,
so text cannot inject markup; a widget rides the event's `markup` field instead, whose
one door is `leaf comment`/`leaf reply`, where it is validated against the
vendored registry — the discussion-side analog of `version check`. The browser door refuses the
field, so everything in the log under that name has been through the gate.

Either side can open a thread, and `author` is the whole difference between them. The
user selects a passage and the browser writes the anchor from the
selection; `leaf comment` writes the same anchor from a quote, reading the
version the way the anchor pass reads the DOM (see "passages" below).
Everything downstream already turns on `author`: `leaf wait` prints user
events and the banner counts them, so Claude's own comment neither wakes its
watcher nor reads as unanswered. What Claude cannot do is `resolve` — a note's
purpose is discharged by being read, and only the reader knows that happened;
closing one from this side would file it away unread.

Commands:
    status, wait, ack, comment, reply, report, events, transcript
    page       init catalog media state
    customize  theme widget
    version    check publish export
    server     run stop

`version check` is a deterministic pre-handover lint (no browser, near-free;
`version publish` re-runs it on every version): the HTML parses with balanced
tags; the page carries exactly one external script
(<script type="module" src="/leaf.js">) and one stylesheet link
(/theme.css); every lf-* element validates against the vendored registry
(schema, nesting, no self-closing form); every lf-* meta is a known page
declaration with an allowed value; each lf-suggestion is well formed (at most
one of each slot, at least one of them, no nesting, `resolves` naming a real
comment); ids are unique and every id from the previous version survives
unless the log settled the widget holding it; no fixed-pixel-width element
is wider than the readable column. Near-free and deterministic is what makes
running it on every version affordable, so keep a new check that way; anything
needing a browser belongs in `--render`.

`version check --render` adds the browser half, run once before a page's URL is first
handed over: the version loads in the machine's installed Chrome (Playwright
`channel="chrome"` — the caller supplies playwright, which `bin/leaf` does
on seeing `--render`) and the render invariants the static lint cannot reach run
against it — no console or page errors, no fail-soft error box, every visible
widget occupies real space, code that reads against the block it is set on, no
sideways scroll, in both color schemes.
The invariants live in render_version, which tests/test_render.py drives over
the shipped examples, so the gate and the suite cannot drift apart.

Passages: an anchor is resolved in the browser and written down here, so
`leaf comment` reads a version the way the anchor pass reads the DOM — text
in document order, minus the runtime's own words, plus the words a widget says
through an x-says attribute, one space wherever the enclosing text block
changes, whitespace collapsed. What the file cannot know is what a widget's
module will write, so the reading stops where the registry stops telling it:
an upgraded element is opaque unless x-verbatim says its body reaches the
reader as its own words, and an opaque element and each of its children is
fenced. A quote never spans a fence, so "the page has words here that the file
doesn't" is a refusal when the comment is written rather than an anchor that
detaches later in the user's browser. Element-anchor an opaque widget
instead (`--section`), which is the anchor a click on a diagram makes.

A version is written in more than one language, and each is read by a parser for
that language: _StructParser for what the markup declares, page_passages for what
it says, tinycss2 for the CSS a <style> block holds. A
new question about a version is a field on one of those readings rather than a
pattern over the file's text, because a pattern answers something adjacent to the
question asked — the readable-column check below carries what that cost.

    shares: a jump host or NAT between them and this machine leaves it
    unroutable from where they sit, and no derivation from this end can know the

    The key exists because serving anywhere but loopback puts an unauthenticated
    writer on whatever network reached us, and `POST /api/event` appends to a log
    that outranks the document and replays onto every version after.

    One key for the machine rather than one per page, because every page here
    goes to the same reader — the one person the agent is working with. A page
    has nothing to keep from another page's reader, which is what lets the
    `others` menu link them, and what lets the cookie jar, scoped by host and
    blind to the port, hold one key under one name.

    The cost is that handing out any page's URL hands out every page on the
    machine, present and future. Leaf has one reader; giving it a second
    means scoping the key back to the page first.

    The cookie is a second copy of that cost: a browser's jar is port-blind, so
    any server the reader visits on the same host string — a dev server on
    localhost:3000 — receives the key with their request. Considered and kept:
    every cookie-borne credential has this property (a port-scoped name or a
    derived value is still delivered to every port and replayable against this
    one), and dropping the cookie for a key-in-URL scheme breaks the thing the
    cookie exists for — the page's static asset references (/leaf.js, a module's
    ../leaf.js import) can carry no query, so every asset would need the auth
    the redirect-following request has. The boundary is the host string; a
    reader on a shared or hostile-local-service machine narrows it by serving
    on a name other servers don't share (--host).

// - applyAction states an absolute placement, never a relative mutation —
//   replay applies it on every later version, and the sender's own action
//   must be a no-op. `version check --render` re-applies the standing state and
//   reports a widget that moves under it.
// - A holder whose slots declare x-retired-when writes data-lf-state="<outcome>"
//   on itself as it settles. That attribute is what the page reads to know a slot
//   has left it — the file's reading takes the same fact from the log — so a module
//   that settles without writing it leaves `leaf comment` refusing a quote into
//   words the reader can still see and select.
// - Read your own slot with says(el), never textContent: the runtime's hidden
//   comment line lands inside widgets legitimately.
// - Anything you inject is chrome only if marked: offer() for a control,
//   relabel() for a label that is the page speaking. Unmarked injected words
//   read as the page's and break the file-side anchor reading.
// - The registry entry declares x-verbatim because this stub leaves the body
//   in place. Drop it the moment the module renders anything in the body's
//   stead, or quotes anchor on words the screen no longer shows.
// - Keys go through keys(el, title, rows) at upgrade, never at module load: one
//   declaration is the dispatch, the key line and the "?" reference, so a row
//   cannot say one key and answer another. Rows carry their own liveness (when),
//   so a control whose keys change with its state declares every state once and
//   calls paintKeys(); a row that presses must say a word for the line.
// - Before wiring any input that would carry an edit back, consult quoted():
//   an exhibited copy of this widget takes no input.

# Widget vocabulary, vendored for this page — `version check` validates against it.
#
# Widgets are lf-* elements in the authored HTML; attributes carry scalars
# (enums, flags), children carry prose, and an item's title is a leading
# <strong> child. Every lf-* element takes an explicit end tag — never
# <lf-foo/>. Ids are authored (lowercase kebab), unique, stable across
# versions. Each entry is JSON Schema over the attributes; x-parent names the
# required parent, x-content the content model (prose | items | data | none).
# A "data" body is one <pre> holding text in the notation the description
# names, < > escaped — <pre> because that is the only thing in HTML that says
# whitespace is load-bearing without a stylesheet to read.
# x-upgrade marks tags a JS module enhances in the browser — the interactive
# widgets and the data-body renderers; x-says names the attributes whose values
# the reader sees as words, and the edge each renders at, so the user can
# select and comment on them like any other text on the page. x-verbatim marks
# an upgraded element whose body reaches the reader as its own words, which is
# what makes it quotable — a body without it is source the widget renders.
# x-language names the attribute carrying a code language, which is checked
# against the one list this page colors from (printed below). x-awaits marks a
# tag whose instances stand as requests to the reader — what the banner counts
# and the `a` key steps through, so a page's open questions are findable
# without the reader hunting for them. x-report is the agent channel: verbs a
# worker folds onto the page with `leaf report`, standing as provisional
# state until a version absorbs or overrules them (printed below as $report).
# x-wide marks a tag whose instances stand wider than the prose column when the
# window has the room — evidence as wide as what it holds, a board's columns or
# a diagram's graph, against prose set to a measure. Nothing is authored for it
# and no page asks: the widget kind declares it and the theme grows the element
# out of the column into whichever margins are free. A `box` stops at one width
# the whole vocabulary shares; a `drawing` takes the room, so a diagram wider
# than the window scrolls in its own box rather than being cut off. A margin
# holding something of the page's — a change's controls, a sidenote — gives
# nothing, so the exhibit that grows is never drawn over the apparatus beside it.

# block of its own beside six that already say the same thing differently. $events is

# ---------- passages: the text an anchor points at ----------
# The runtime resolves an anchor against the DOM; `leaf comment` writes one down
# against the file. The two have to read the same page or the anchor lands somewhere it
# was never made, so this mirrors leaf.js's capture rather than approximating it:
# the same skip list, the same block-boundary space, the same collapse, the same caps.
#
# What the file cannot know is what a widget's module will write, and the registry is
# where that is declared rather than guessed at per widget. Three keywords carry what
# can be declared, and a fence carries the rest:
#
#   x-says      attribute values the reader sees. renderSaid puts them in the DOM, so
#               they go in here too, at the edge the registry names.
#   x-verbatim  an upgraded element whose body reaches the reader as its own words
#               (lf-draft renders the authored text into a plain div, deliberately
#               unmarked so anchoring can see it). Without it, an upgraded element is
#               opaque: a mermaid body is a picture by the time it is read.
#   x-retired-when  the outcome under which this element leaves the page: a decided
#               suggestion's losing slot. The browser builds its anchor pass's skip
#               list from this key too (`quotable` in leaf.js), so a reading given
#               the log's outcomes drops here exactly what drops there — and a widget
#               whose decision leaves nothing showing goes with its slots (settledAway
#               there, `gone` here). Its values are also the vocabulary's decision
#               verbs, which is where `decisions` reads them from.
#   x-state, record kind "body"  the verb whose detail text becomes this element's
#               body once the user sends one (lf-draft's `edit`): replay writes
#               the newest surviving one into the DOM verbatim (applyAction is
#               absolute), so a reading given the fold's word (rewritten_bodies)
#               holds their words in the authored body's place. It asks nothing of
#               the browser, whose page already shows the text this substitutes.
#
# A module writes between the children of the element it upgrades — a column's heading, a
# milestone's chips, a diff's gutters — so an opaque element and each of its children is
# fenced. A quote never spans a fence, which turns "the page has words here that the file
# doesn't" from an anchor that silently detaches in the user's browser into a refusal
# at the moment it is written, addressed to the one party who can still fix it.
#

    `decided` is the accept/reject each suggestion stands under (`decisions`).
    A decision retires a slot — the registry's `x-retired-when` names which outcome —
    and the browser's anchor pass reads the same key (`quotable` in leaf.js), so
    this reading drops it the same way. A decision that leaves its
    widget with nothing — a deletion accepted, an insertion refused — empties the

    standing text per element whose registry entry records a verb as the body
    (`rewritten_bodies`): their words stand in the authored body's place, because
    replay writes exactly that into the DOM. Without either, the reading is the
    version as authored — every slot pending, every body Claude's.

    close() deliberately does not unwind the stack. An element still open at EOF

# ---------- the readable column ----------
# A rule, a style="" and a width="" are the three places a document states a width.
# The first two are CSS, so tinycss2 reads them; the third is an attribute, so the
# markup parser does.
#
# Three patterns over the file's text came first, and each answered something adjacent
# to the question asked: the document read as a stylesheet handed a screenshot's base64
# to the rule walker, `width` needed a lookbehind to exclude `max-width` because it
# matched a name instead of reading a property, and the scan for `style=""` never saw
# one written with the other quote. Hand-rolling the parser is the same mistake a level
# down, and harder to see, because a hand-rolled parser is right about the grammar it
# was written against: the brace walk those patterns became knew that a comment's braces
# are not braces, and still read a `}` inside `content: "}"` as the end of the block,
# dropping every declaration after it in that rule; still read a rule holding both
# declarations and a nested rule as declaring nothing of its own; and still told a fixed
# `900px` from a `calc(100% - 900px)` by asking whether the string ended in `px`, which
# `900px !important` does not. CSS has no parser in the stdlib, so the dependency is a
# real cost — one more wheel behind every `version check`, ~6ms to read the theme — and
# it buys the grammar whole rather than one bug's worth at a time.

    failure itself — its code blocks carried no ids, so a comment aimed at one fell
    through to the enclosing section and read as the gesture being broken rather
    than the page being bare, and nothing anywhere said so.

    A section or article is named outright; a block below one only where its aim
    escapes to a sectioning element. The ancestor's tag stands in for tightness —
    a figure around a table, a card around a pre — which no static read can
    measure, so a page-wide <div id> also passes for aim enough and the advice
    stays quiet. Undercounting is the right error for advice: a miss costs one

    """The other half of the id-survival rule. That one keeps a republish from
    dropping the anchors a user hung on the page; this one keeps it from
    dropping the decisions they recorded on it. CLAUDE.md carries why the log
    outranks the markup and what that cost.

    The runtime replays every action onto every later version, so a version
    cannot revise what a user acted on: replay would paint their recorded
    state back over the revision and the new words would reach nobody. A version
    that means to revise says so — `restated` on what it rewrote — and one that
    changes those words in silence is refused here. An unearned `restated` is an
    error too: a decision thrown away for nothing, and, left unchecked, the
    one-word ritual that would make this gate meaningless.

    The comparison is the words each version says (`spoken`), because words are
    what a decision is about. Re-indenting a draft, marking the picked option
    `chosen`, or relocating a card the user already moved is not a revision,
    and neither is writing their own edit back — a version that says what they
    said is agreeing with them.

    Words are one divergence kind; declared state is the other. For each verb
    the registry declares (x-state), the fold gives the user's standing
    state per unit, and a version whose markup actively changes that unit's
    record away from both the previous version's and the fold is refused the
    same way a silent rewrite of words is. Writing the folded state is the
    state-level echo (honoring); re-emitting the previous version's state is
    blessed silence, which replay resolves; a unit with no surviving folded
    action is exempt — never decided, or retracted back to the author. And
    `restated` is earned by either divergence kind: a words-unchanged
    relocation earns it at the unit even though no subject's words moved."""

# Words the page shows that no user can select, and so no comment can be

# static lint can see, and a page-local widget is where both keep happening.
#
# It can paint them: `content: attr(label)` puts a heading on screen and in no
# text node, so a selection can't cover it. The runtime says the attributes the
# registry marks x-says, and a widget's module says the rest (a chip row, a
# heading that doubles as a list's accessible name); either way, none of an
# element's own attribute values should still be reaching the reader as
# generated content.
#
# Or it can leave them under .lf-ui with nothing said about whose words they are.
# That class is the chrome face, a look — reaching for it as a general "this is
# chrome" marker is how a user ends up unable to comment on a heading they can
# see. The declaration is made where the label is written: data-lf-said for the page
# speaking, which the anchor pass reads over the box around it, data-lf-offer for a
# thing to work. So inside a widget, every word under .lf-ui has to be declared the
# page's, be a control's own label, or be the line the paint pass writes to say how
# many comments a block carries: that one is about the document rather than of it,
# which is the same reason it wears .lf-ui at all, and it lands inside a widget
# whenever a comment does. The comment panel is out of scope: a widget in a reply is
# markup frozen in the event log, not the document.
#
# And a declared label inside a form control is out of reach whatever it is marked:
# Chrome starts no pointer selection inside one, which is why `offer` builds a press
# as a span wearing role="button". A widget reaching for <button> anyway is the one
# mistake the marker cannot fix, so it is reported separately and says why.

# Content set outside the column it belongs to. The sideways-scroll reading is
# the same question asked of the window, and the window is the wider of the two:
# the gate renders at 1200px against a 720px column, so 200px of margin on each
# side absorbs a spill that scrolls nothing. What is out there is the
# margin, where a suggestion's controls hang, and the user's own window is
# free to be narrower than this one — so a page that passed here scrolls
# sideways on the machine it was written for.
#
# The static lint asks about the column too (_column_width), and asks it of the
# stylesheet, because that is all a linter has: a width the author pinned in
# pixels, against a number parsed out of a max-width. This is the same column
# with a layout engine behind it, so it is measured rather than parsed, and it
# catches what no declaration states — a vw width, an unbreakable table, a
# widget that came out wider than its content.
#
# Two kinds of element answer for their own width and not to this, and both say
# so in their computed style. The margin has legitimate residents — a
# suggestion's controls, a sidenote, the hidden line the paint pass writes — and
# each is out there by its own declaration: placed absolutely, or floated clear
# of the column. Where the box sits is what separates a resident from a spill,
# which crosses the column's edge rather than clearing it, having started inside
# and run out. So a float that merely overflows is still reported, and a widget's
# own float inside the column (an option's .facts rail) is never in question.
#
# A resident answers for what it holds, which is why both readings are made up the
# ancestors and not of the element alone. A sidenote is prose, so it carries the
# <code>, links and emphasis any other prose does, and each of those inherits a box
# its parent put in the margin on purpose — named, one by one, as spilling out of a
# column none of them was ever in.
#
# And a scroll container answers for what it
# holds: a box inside one runs on past the clip and is drawn only as far as its
# container reaches, so a wide table's own rows would otherwise be reported as
# spilling out of the table that is containing them. What is left is the flow,
# which the column is the whole width of. A spill is reported once, at the
# outermost element that has it, because everything inside one inherits its box
# and would name the same fault a dozen times over.

# Whether an applyAction is absolute, which is the premise both folds and every view
# built on them rest on and the one thing about a widget module no gate could see. A
# relative implementation — a card shifted one column along, a pick toggled rather than
# set — is invisible to every other reading here: it renders perfectly, and what it
# costs arrives later, in the poll that replays the sender's own action over the state
# that gesture already painted. The user drags a card once and watches it walk.
#
# So the page is asked rather than the code. Each standing action is applied a second
# time onto the state the page's own replay produced, and an absolute one has nothing
# to do. Replaying the whole log again would prove nothing — every action carries its
# seq and applyActions retires each exactly once, so a second pass is a no-op whatever
# the widgets do — which is why this reaches past the runtime's bookkeeping and calls
# the method.
#
# The standing state rather than the whole log, because that is the set the contract is
# for: the fold's own claim is that the last surviving action per unit *is* the state,
# so the page is already showing exactly these. It is also the set replay applied and
# did not skip — a retracted decision, a version's future action and a widget the
# markup dropped are all out of it — so nothing here re-applies what the page declined.
#
# The whole set at once and in the log's order, never one action measured on its own.
# An absolute applyAction states its own unit and says nothing about any other, so where
# two units share an ordered container the page is the sequence's result rather than any
# one action's: two cards dragged to the head of one column leave it holding the second
# above the first, and lifting the first back over the second is what replaying it alone
# is *supposed* to do. Read per action, that named lf-board relative and refused a page
# with nothing wrong with it — at the gate a handover cannot get past. Read across the
# batch, an absolute set lands exactly where it already was and a relative one walks.
#
# Two readings, because one is blind where the other sees. shallowSigs is the id-bearing
# markup state, which covers a moved card, a flipped attribute and a re-pointed pick;
# it looks away from text on purpose, and a `body` record is nothing but text, so the
# unit's declared facet is read beside it. A throw is a finding of its own rather than
# an exception out of the gate: whatever a second application was expected to do, it was
# not that. Each moved id is then laid at the door of the widget whose applyAction writes
# it — its nearest ancestor with the method, as a replayed override already is — since

#
# Boxes rather than a hit test, which is the other way to ask: a press landing on the
# wrong element is a different fault with its own test, and the medium this has to hold
# up in is the copy, where there is nothing left to press. Text against text, because
# text over a background, a border, or a picture is how a page is built.
#
# A pair where one element contains the other is skipped: a paragraph and the <em>
# inside it are one run of words that the flow lays out together, and their boxes
# overlap by construction. Two pixels of slack, since a line box carries its leading and
# adjacent blocks can round into each other by a hair. The runtime's layer is skipped
# too: it floats over the document on purpose, and where that costs the user a press
# it is the hit test that says so.
#
# The layer is in two places, so the skip names both. The line counting a passage's
# comments lives inside the page's own elements by design — it is what a screen reader
# hears where a painted mark says nothing — and it is clipped to nothing on screen.
# checkVisibility answers for display, visibility and opacity and knows nothing of
# clip-path, so that line read as drawn, and its text lays out past the 1px box holding
# it: an anchor on a container put "1 comment" across the paragraph below the widget and
# failed the gate on a page with nothing wrong with it. Asking for `.lf-chrome` alone was
# the class standing in for the question, the same substitution the anchor pass made with
# `.lf-ui`. The question is whose words these are, and the runtime marks its own in both
# of the places it writes them.
#
# checkVisibility knows nothing of content-visibility either, which is what a collapse
# wears: an inactive tab's panel and a settled group's cards are hidden="until-found" so
# that find-in-page still reaches inside, and the text in one reports the boxes it last
# laid out in — every sibling's at the same place. So a page with a collapsed group on it
# failed about half the runs and passed the rest, which is the worst way for a gate to be
# wrong: the page that goes out is whichever one the coin was kind to. A collapse is asked
# for, and words nobody can see are not drawn over anything, so [hidden] is held out here
# the way the size check holds it out. The coin comes down the same side every time on a

# Code that came out the colour of the code around it. Colouring takes two halves that
# meet nowhere a static lint can reach: the runtime writes data-lf-syn in the browser,
# and the theme answers it with a var() the browser resolves. Either half can stop
# working with nothing said — the tokenizer failing throws, and the console error is
# already a finding here, but a stylesheet that no longer answers a role, or answers it
# with an ink too near the paper, is silent. What reaches the user is a page of code in
# one flat colour, which is what they report as the highlighting being gone; it was
# reported that way, on a comment that was 3.3:1 against the block it sat on.
#
# So both halves are asked of the drawn result rather than of the declarations behind it.
# A palette can be read out of the stylesheet; what a role came out as cannot, because a
# project overlays its own theme over this one and the browser is the only thing that
# knows which declaration won.
#
# Once per role and surface rather than once per span: the fault belongs to the role, not
# to the hundredth span wearing it, and a role reads differently on a diff's del tint than
# on the plain block, so the pair is what a reading answers for. A page of code costs a
# couple of dozen of them rather than one per token — measured at under 10ms across the
# examples. The line is per role, since the palette is where the fix goes and a role
# failing on two tints is one thing to change.
#
# What a colour is comes back from the browser painting it, not from a parse of how it
# wrote it down — getComputedStyle serializes a hex as rgb() in 0–255 and a color-mix as
# color(srgb …) in 0–1, and a probe reading one as the other reports a ratio against a
# colour nothing on the page is. Painting the backgrounds in order composites the
# translucent ones the way the page does, over the white the browser paints under
# everything, so a tint over a tint is the colour the reader actually has behind the
# glyphs. A marked passage is not among them: the highlight registry styles glyphs and
# not boxes, so a mark is no element's background, and it is the user's own paint over a
# page that had to be legible before they put it there.
#
# 4.5:1 is WCAG AA for body text, and body text is the threshold that applies — code is
# 13px. Axe runs over this corpus too and passes it, which is not the same guarantee:
# asked for colour-contrast alone on the example carrying the beige comment, it returned
# 44 passing elements, no violation, and not one of the spans among them.
#
# Which shadow roots it crosses into is OPEN_ROOTS' answer (the section note above says
# why it crosses at all), which is the choice everything else here makes — colour is
# asked of what the browser painted, so where it painted is too, and a root a widget

# listening (renderQuiet) — so the declaration is what this asks against.
#
# Both passes run once at the upgrade, before an async widget's own render lands, so a
# module that rebuilds its body from a settle() promise takes the words out with it and
# nothing on the page says so. renderQuiet re-runs on each replay and renderSaid never
# does, which decides how long each stays gone rather than whether it goes.
#
# It reads every open root (OPEN_ROOTS) where both word passes stop at the boundary on
# purpose: which widgets the page holds is the document's question, and settling a
# staged widget's nesting in a sweep would be writing that contract where nobody would

# what an element says rather than a second reading spelled here — asked of the host's
# root where there is one, since the walk behind it substitutes a declared root for a
# *child* and never for the element it was handed. The quiet word is in no such reading,
# wearing the .lf-ui that `says` skips on purpose, so what is asked of it is its box: a
# span clipped to a pixel still has one wherever it renders, and none at all where it
# doesn't. A collapsed card lays out nothing either and is asked for, so [hidden] is held

# Attributes standing on a widget that its entry never declared. The schema is the
# whole of the author's namespace — `additionalProperties: false` on every tag — and
# the static lint holds a version file to it. What no reading of a file can see is the
# other writer: a module, which upgrades the element and may leave anything it likes on
# it. So a module writes in that namespace only where the registry declares the
# attribute as a verb's record form (`chosen`, `status`), which is what makes the write
# a statement the log's fold, the state gate and the record-lag report can all read.
# Everything else it needs to mark goes where the module's own words go — the chrome it
# built, in the platform's vocabulary (aria-*, role, hidden, tabindex) or under data-*,
# which is the layer's and a widget's alike.
#
# lf-options had two of the other kind, and both were quiet. `answered` recorded a verb
# only a thread can post, and a thread's markup is frozen in the log, so no version
# could ever have honored a record of it; `open` recorded which way this tab last left
# a disclosure, which no version carries at all. Neither reached a consumer, and the
# one reader that did see them read them wrong: shallowSigs excludes exactly the
# attributes no version can assert, and its exclusion list is the runtime's own paint —
# so a widget writing beside it is counted as state the author wrote, in the reading
# `version check --render` uses to decide whether a version overrules the user.

# A box that draws an inset and shows a different one. A child's outer margin normally
# collapses through its parent and is spent between blocks; where the parent draws
# something at that edge, or holds a formatting context of its own, it cannot get out and
# is painted as the parent's inset instead. So the number a stylesheet states is not the
# number a reader sees, and which of the two they get depends on what the author wrote
# inside: a card ending in a sentence showed its 16px, the same card ending in a paragraph
# showed 29. theme.css states the trim and a box opts in where it draws the frame
# (`--lf-frame`); this is what says when one hasn't.
#
# It is a reading of the rendered page because nothing else can be. The trim is a style
# query, the frame is a declaration in whichever layer drew the box, and a project overlays
# its own theme over leaf's — so which rule won, and whether the child that ended up at the
# edge is the one the stylesheet's author had in mind, are facts only the browser holds. A
# lint over the CSS would be reading the declarations and not the result, which is the same
# mistake the reserved-width lint made before the press sweep replaced it.
#
# Two exclusions, both about what a margin means where it stands. A flex or grid container
# collapses no margin anywhere, so a margin on an item at its edge is a placement rather
# than room that could not get out — the switch under a screenshot pair carries 3px of
# exactly that, the UA's own on a checkbox. And an edge whose box is a generated one (a
# pseudo-element, an `x-says` word, an injected control) is the layer's own paint, stated
# in the same rule as the frame: what the trim looks for is the first and last block the
# page itself put there, so this looks for the same, and a card's absolutely-positioned
# pick mark is not the thing under its last paragraph.
