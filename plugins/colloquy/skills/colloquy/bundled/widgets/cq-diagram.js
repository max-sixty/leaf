/* cq-diagram: renders a mermaid-source body, upgraded because it parses. The body is
 * data, not prose — the theme shows it as source until the SVG replaces it, so a page
 * degrades readably if rendering fails (the source stays visible in the error box).
 * The vendored mermaid bundle loads lazily, once, and only on pages that use it. */

/* A diagram paints its own boxes, which makes it the one widget that can hold a
 * palette of its own — and it did: mermaid's stock "neutral" is a cool grey, so
 * every diagram sat on the page as a slab of a different theme. The tokens are the
 * page's answer to what a surface, a rule and a label look like, so the diagram
 * takes them too, read off the document rather than restated here. `base` is the
 * theme that accepts them; the named themes derive their own and ignore most of
 * what you pass. `darkMode` is the one thing the tokens can't say, because it tells
 * mermaid which way to derive the variables it wasn't given.
 *
 * Read once, at load. A page whose OS flips scheme mid-read keeps the palette it
 * started in until reload — the same as the vendored highlight table, and unlike
 * the rest of the theme, which is tokens and follows live. Re-rendering every
 * diagram on a media-query change would be the alternative, and it buys a case
 * (the OS theme changing while a user reads) that costs a reload to fix. */
