"""The published site: what the build assembles, and what a reader gets.

The site is the repo's own pages plus an export of every example, so most of what
could go wrong is a path that meant one thing in a checkout and another on a host.
The build resolves every local link it wrote and stops on one that reaches
nothing, which is the failure a static host answers with a 404 and no other
signal; these tests hold the rest — that the theme a page links is the shipped
file, that an exported example still stands up with its scripts gone, and that a
site claiming to ride the theme's tokens actually changes colour when the
theme's palette does.
