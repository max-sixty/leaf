/* cq-tabs: parallel workstreams on one page, one panel on screen at a time.
 * The upgrade builds the strip from the panels' `label` attributes and hides
 * inactive panels with hidden="until-found", so browser find-in-page and
 * fragment navigation still reach them — `beforematch` opens the owning tab,
 * and the runtime's reveal() asks the same via the cq-reveal event when it
 * scrolls to a comment anchor. The open tab is view state for this reader,
 * remembered per browser tab in sessionStorage like the scroll position:
 * switching is reading, not editing, so it never sends an action and no
 * version carries it — this widget doesn't ride the action channel at all.
 * While the version diff is on, a tab whose panel holds marked passages wears
 * a Δ count, so a change can't hide behind an inactive tab. Unupgraded,
 * panels stack as labeled sections; authored content is never replaced, so
 * there is no failSoft. */
