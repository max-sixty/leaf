/* lf-shot: a before/after pair of screenshots of one view, shown one at a time in one
 * frame.
 *
 * The comparison is a flip, not a wipe. A wipe puts the two states either side of a
 * divider, so it reads a change only where the change happens to cross the divider;
 * anything wholly on one side is a thing the eye has to carry across the seam and hold
 * in memory. Swapping one registered frame for the other leaves the change as the only
 * thing on screen that moves — the blink comparator's trick, and how it found a planet.
 *
 * Everything the flip needs is native: the state is a radio group, the swap a
 * `:has(:checked)` rule in the theme. No handler runs after the upgrade, so a serialized
 * copy of this page — DOM kept, script tags dropped — still flips, and a printed one
 * stacks both frames instead. A dragged slider would have survived neither.
 *
 * Two kinds of word, and they are marked differently on purpose. Each frame's caption
 * names which state it holds, which is the widget's own word and the only thing telling
 * the two frames apart once paper has both of them on the page: data-lf-gen alone, so
 * the version diff looks away and the user can still select it. The radio beside it
 * is a thing to press, so it goes through `offer` with the rest of the chrome. What the
 * page has to say about the change itself is neither — it is prose, written around the
 * element, where a comment can reach it like any other sentence. */
