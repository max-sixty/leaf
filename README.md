Generative UI for agents: the agent builds you the page rather than a scroll of
terminal text — a plan whose options you press to decide, a triage board you drag, a
dashboard that keeps up while a long job runs. When the project needs a widget that
doesn't exist, the agent writes one, and the same theme and checks cover it.

Underneath is a messaging and collaboration bus. Select any line and comment on it
like a shared doc, or drag a card, or rewrite a draft in your own words: it all
reaches the session as structured events, and the agent answers in the margin and
ships a revised version. The browser follows along on its own. Leaf is a plugin —
Claude Code and Codex so far.

![leaf demo](docs/demo.gif)

<https://leaf.page/> is the tour, the mechanism, the example pages, and the guide to
themes and project widgets. Each page uses leaf's own theme, so they double as
specimens, and each opens the same from a checkout ([`docs/`](docs/)) as from the web.

## Install

Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add max-sixty/leaf
/plugin install leaf@leaf
```

Codex:

```
codex plugin marketplace add max-sixty/leaf
codex plugin add leaf@leaf
```

No config or account is required. It needs
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on `PATH` (`interact.py` declares its dependencies
in a PEP 723 header) and a browser on the same machine as the session.

Then ask the agent for a page. The explicit skill is `/leaf [topic]` in Claude Code
and `$leaf [topic]` in Codex; with no argument it presents whatever the session is
currently about.

## Customize

Project customizations live in `.leaf/`; user customizations live in
`~/.config/leaf/`. The agent works the project layer with the same commands when it
generates a widget. A short theme file cascades over the defaults, and a widget
scaffold adds a registry entry, CSS, and optionally an ES module:

```
leaf customize theme
leaf customize widget lf-callout
```

Add `--upgrade` to the widget's first scaffold command when it needs browser
behavior.

The next `leaf page init <page-dir>` vendors the merged layer. The
[customization guide](docs/customizing.html) covers the file contracts and the
project/user precedence.

## Examples

[`examples/`](examples/) holds a complete page for each kind of work, including a
dashboard meant to change as work finishes. They are live at
<https://leaf.page/examples.html>, and `gallery.html` puts them on one page as tabs.

## Experiments

Liable to change or disappear. Leaf works the same without them.

### Channel mode (Claude Code)

Off by default. With it on, a long reply lands in the page chunk by chunk as it is
composed rather than appearing whole at the end, and the loop stops needing the
background `leaf wait` it otherwise restarts after every batch. Claude Code's
channels are a research preview, so the mode exists only for a session launched
with the flag:

```
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:leaf@leaf
```

It confirms at startup; an alias keeps the flag out of daily typing. A session
launched without the flag behaves exactly as before, and the agent confirms
delivery before relying on the channel, so a flag misremembered can't strand your
comments.

<details>
<summary>Turning it on across an organization</summary>

On a Team or Enterprise plan channels stay blocked until an Owner turns them on
(claude.ai → Admin settings → Claude Code → Channels), and an admin who names leaf in
`allowedChannelPlugins` retires the flag for everyone in the org — that list replaces
Anthropic's default, so it names every channel plugin the org allows:

```json
{
  "channelsEnabled": true,
  "allowedChannelPlugins": [{ "marketplace": "leaf", "plugin": "leaf" }]
}
```

Either way the launch flag becomes `claude --channels plugin:leaf@leaf`, with no
confirmation, once leaf is on the effective allowlist.
