# marked is zero-dependency and its package export is already one browser-native
# ESM file, so unlike highlight.js there is nothing to bundle: vendoring is a
# copy out of the published package. The runtime renders every message's text
# with it; what it may not do — pass raw HTML through, since a message injects
# widgets only via the event's `markup` field — is configured where it is
# loaded, in leaf.js, not patched here.
