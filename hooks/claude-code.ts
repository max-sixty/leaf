/**
 * Leaf's Claude Code hooks module: the band above the prompt that shows the
 * session's pages, and the drawing of Leaf's own rows in the conversation. Claude
 * Code loads it from the installed plugin (measured at 2.1.305). It neither
 * watches nor wakes the session: `hooks.json`'s background Stop registration
 * keeps the watch between turns. A watch here would wake with a prompt, which
 * Claude Code drops from an Escape until the user next types, so every wake after
 * an Escape became a cross-session nudge (measured at 2.1.307 with the
 * claude-code journey).
 *
 * Starting an idle turn always draws a row, and no hook or exit code wakes the
 * session without one (read in 2.1.307's source). The watch's wake is a task
 * notification whose summary `hooks.json` names (`rewakeSummary`, an internal
 * field of Claude Code's hook schema), and the module draws that row as nothing,
 * leaving the band to show the agent at work; a nudge, which comes as another
 * session's message, it draws as one dim line. The model reads both whole, and
 * ctrl+o shows them as Claude Code draws them.
 *
 * A module's processes inherit Claude Code's own environment, which names no
 * session of its own, so every call states the session and Claude Code's process
 * as a hook's environment does. That process is the parent of every process the
 * module starts (measured at Claude Code 2.1.291). A follower that fails reports
 * its diagnostics through Claude Code's UI log.
 *
 * The band has a line for each live page the session holds: the word Leaf in the
 * tone the page's Leaf panel gives its leaf, a link to the page, what is On the
 * user, and its open threads with how many hold words the user hasn't read, the
 * counts the panel marks, then the agent's status. It goes above whatever other
 * plugins draw there. Claude Code keeps an empty row between the band and the
 * prompt (measured at 2.1.306); a negative margin to close it hides the band.
 * `leaf-dev claude-code-session` runs a session that draws it from this tree.
 *
 * A follower (`bin/leaf hook --harness claude-code
 * --if-claimed --pages`) prints that list whenever it changes and exits once the
 * session holds no page; the launcher answers it without starting uv in a session
 * holding none. The session takes a page only through a `leaf` command, so the
 * module starts the follower as the session starts, after each Bash call that
 * runs `leaf`, and as a turn starts or a main-loop turn ends, once none is
 * running; a request while one runs starts another once it exits.
