/* lf-task: upgraded because its chip row (`owner`, `when`, each `tags` entry,
 * and a parent's done-fraction) outruns CSS's two pseudo-elements, and the
 * fraction is a count over the subtree that no stylesheet can compute. The
 * upgrade only inserts a built chip row after the leading <strong>; authored
 * text is preserved verbatim — an error here surfaces on the console and
 * leaves the prose untouched, so there is no failSoft. The guides, indent,
 * and status marker are theme CSS.
 *
 * The chips are real text for the same reason lf-milestone's are: the
 * reviewer has to be able to select and quote a word the page says. The
 * fraction counts leaf tasks — descendants with no lf-task children — because
 * the leaves are the work and a parent is the grouping of it; counting parents
 * too would double-count every level of structure. It is a count, not an
 * effort estimate, so it says "n/m done" rather than a percentage: a fraction
 * wears its basis on its face where a bare "40%" invites more trust than a
 * count deserves.
 *
 * `status` is also the widget's agent channel (x-report): a worker's report
 * replays here through applyAction, which states the absolute value — the
 * attribute — so a reload or a second tab converges and re-applying is a
 * no-op. The status marker follows the attribute through theme CSS for free;
 * what has to be recomputed is the done-fraction, a count over the whole
 * tree, so every task's chip row re-renders rather than this one guessing
 * which ancestors the count reaches. Rebuilding is idempotent, and the rows
 * are generated (data-lf-gen), so the diff and the anchor pass already look
 * away. */
