/* lf-options: a question the reader answers. The theme draws both of its forms and
 * this module makes them answerable — without it the markup still reads as a decision,
 * and nothing here is load-bearing on the look.
 *
 * Which form a group takes is a fact about its options, decided in CSS and never here:
 * an option leading with a <strong> title argues its own case and is a card on a row of
 * its own, and a group whose options are bare labels is a question *about* the page,
 * drawn as compact rows.
 * The difference this module sees is only what a row adds — `for`, the id of the block
 * the row names, rendered as a reference the reader can follow. It points and never
 * speaks: the label stays written in the markup, so the file's reading of the page
 * holds every word the page shows.
 *
 * `choose` takes the reader's pick. Every option carries one injected mark that is both
 * the keyboard path and the state — a toggle reading "choose one" or "choose any" as the
 * group takes one option or several, which becomes "your pick" once this reader picks it,
 * or "chosen" where the document already carries it. One
 * element for both, so nothing hides, nothing moves, and a keyboard pick leaves focus
 * where it was. Which word a mark wears is asked of the option rather than of the call
 * that changed it: picked and authored-chosen reads "chosen", picked otherwise reads
 * "your pick". Outside a `choose` group the same mark renders as a span — the document's
 * state, with nothing to press, and so a passage a user can quote rather than a
 * label anchoring skips.
 *
 * The pick is a set, whatever the group allows. `multiple` lets it hold more than one
 * and clicking toggles each option in or out; without it a click makes that option the
 * only pick and clicking it again empties the set. One shape either way — the action
 * states the whole set, absolutely, so replaying this tab's own pick is a no-op and a
 * second tab converges rather than drifting. A click the whole option takes is one
 * nothing in the option wanted: a drag that ended here is that selection's, and a press
 * on the evidence an option argues from — a shot to flip, a disclosure to open, a link
 * to follow — belongs to what it landed on (`worksInside`).
 *
 * A choose group also carries a box for words (the runtime's `sayBox`). A question can
 * always be answered off its own menu — "none of these", or a pick's why — and without
 * a box that answer costs the reader a hunt for some passage to select. What they type
 * goes back as a comment anchored on the group, so it is a thread beside the question
 * rather than a channel of its own. In a thread the runtime returns no box (the
 * thread's reply box is already the words' home), and a `multiple` group grows a Done
 * press instead: every toggle reaches the agent as it lands, so the press is the one
 * statement that the set is whole, posted as an `answer` action and held as the
 * thread ask's closing condition (x-awaits.until). Answered is paint on the press,
 * never a wider word, and the set can still change after — each later toggle still
 * reaches the agent, who reads the log rather than the moment.
 *
 * The keyboard path: every mark is a press, so Tab reaches it and ⏎ toggles. From a
 * mark, ↑/↓ walk the options (a clamp at the ends, not a wrap) and 1–9 pick outright —
 * each option wears its digit in a column of its own, painted only while a mark holds
 * keyboard focus, so nothing appears on a page nobody is answering, and an armed g
 * leader keeps its own digits (leaderArmed). The column is held whether or not a digit
 * is in it, which is the theme's half of this. The rows are declared per mark through
 * keyHint, so the key line and the ? overlay promise what a press does.
 *
 * `settled` retires the decision once it has been made and acted on: the group collapses
 * to one line naming the chosen option, with every option — the chosen one included —
 * behind a disclosure. Nothing is deleted, so the ids, the anchors on them, and check's
 * id-survival rule are all untouched; what's reclaimed is the height. Open or closed is
 * view state for this reader, remembered per browser tab in sessionStorage like a lf-tabs
 * tab: opening a settled group is reading, not editing, so it sends no action and no
 * version carries it. Collapsed options wear hidden="until-found", so find-in-page and
 * the runtime's reveal() (a click on a comment's quote) both open the group rather than
 * jumping to an option nobody can see, and while the version diff is on the row wears a
 * Δ count so a change can't hide behind the collapse. A settled group still takes a pick
 * once opened — settling is a sweep, not a lock, and the summary line follows whatever is
 * chosen, including back to a bare "Settled" when the reader clears it.
 *
 * Inside a <lf-specimen> the group is quoted — exhibited, not offered — so it takes the
 * same path as a group that never declared `choose`: the mark is a span, the click
 * handler is never wired, there is no box for words, and an example decision can't be
 * answered. `settled` still collapses there, because quoting gates the action channel and
 * not presentation.
 *
 * Authored content is never replaced, so there is no failSoft. */
