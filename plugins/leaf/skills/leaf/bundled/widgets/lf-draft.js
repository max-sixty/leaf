/* lf-draft: a block of text the user owns — rewrite it in place, and the exact
 * words reach the agent.
 *
 * The problem this solves that no other widget does: lf-board and lf-options let the
 * user *choose* among things the agent wrote, but never *change* the words. The
 * fastest correction to a sentence is typing the better sentence, not describing it in
 * a comment. That capability is the whole element: one verb (`edit`, the entire new
 * text), no container, no approve/skip chrome. Decisions compose from structures that
 * already own them — put a draft inside a lf-card and the column is the verdict; page
 * assent is sign-off — rather than growing a second set of buttons here.
 *
 * Two rules shape the implementation:
 *
 * 1. Authored text stays in the light DOM as real text. A textarea's value lives off
 *    the text-node tree, so anything inside one is invisible to comment anchoring and
 *    to the version diff. So the body is a plain div — generated, but deliberately NOT
 *    marked .lf-ui or data-lf-gen, because those are exactly the markers that tell the
 *    anchor pass and the diff to look away. A div and not the <pre> the markup wrote,
 *    which would be the tidier swap: <pre> is a text block, and the runtime's comment
 *    line lands on the nearest one, so keeping it puts that line inside the words the
 *    editor is seeded from — the exact failure the marker rules exist for. The textarea
 *    exists only while an edit is open, and its result is written back as text. Read
 *    mode is the resting state; comments and Δ work there. The capture also strips the
 *    indentation the HTML source gave every line, so an agent can indent a draft like
 *    any other child content without the indentation becoming part of the draft's
 *    text.
 * 2. applyAction states absolute values — the whole body, never a patch — so replay is
 *    idempotent, two tabs converge on the last write, and an edit no version has
 *    honored yet re-applies to each new version instead of visibly reverting. Until
 *    one does, the runtime's pending pass marks the element data-lf-pending — the
 *    same mark every decided-and-unhonored widget wears, driven by the registry's
 *    x-state rather than remembered here.
 *
 * Editing has two doors: double-click the text (the fast path), or the ✎ button (the
 * door keyboards and touch can use; it also makes the block *look* editable). It sits
 * in a control row the draft always has, which Cancel and Save join for the length of
 * an edit — one row of the same button either way, so opening one changes what the box
 * offers without changing its shape. Unsent keystrokes ride the runtime's draft store
 * (saveDraft/loadDraft), the composer's discipline: written on input, cleared only by a
 * successful send or explicit Cancel, so reload, version switch, and server death all
 * recover. The stored value is an object rather than the text bare: an empty string is a
 * real replacement here, while the shared store uses a bare empty string to mean remove.
 * Recovery is tab-local; submitted actions converge through the log, but one tab's
 * successful send or Cancel must not erase another tab's newer unsent edit.
 * A send owns the widget until its response, as a composer does; otherwise a second save
 * can overtake the first on the network and the earlier response can clear newer text.
 *
 * Once an edit exists, a native disclosure compares the authored body with the
 * standing one and lists the widget's absolute edit actions in log order. The runtime
 * owns that sequence and its version boundary (`watchActions`); the module owns only
 * its presentation. Restoring a row sends its text as one more ordinary edit, which
 * keeps one state model and lets another tab converge without knowing that the gesture
 * happened in a history view.
 *
 * The fast path is taken on the second mousedown rather than on dblclick, because the
 * word the browser selects is selected *by* that mousedown and painted before dblclick
 * arrives: clearing it afterwards is a frame too late, and the user saw a word
 * flash blue and vanish. Cancelling the mousedown's default means there was never a
 * selection to flash, or a comment button to contest the gesture. What that default
 * was saying — "this word" — is carried into the box instead, where a double-click
 * still means what it means everywhere else: type over this word.
 *
 * Chrome is injected through the runtime's `offer`, which marks it .lf-ui for the chrome
 * look, data-lf-gen so the diff ignores it, and data-lf-offer for a thing to work — which
 * is what keeps it off the printed page, out of the anchor pass (this widget declaring no
 * label the page speaks through), and out of the way of the double-click below; the class
 * also earns the edit box the runtime's one textarea rule. Presentation is theme CSS, the
 * swap between the two views included: an open edit is the box being in the document, so
 * the CSS reads that and this module writes no display state at all. Which is also what
 * lets paper disagree — it drops the box and keeps the words. History is chrome too and
 * exists only on a live page; a scriptless copy cannot honestly offer restore. Authored
 * content is never discarded, so there is no failSoft.
