/* lf-suggestion: Claude's edit to content the user has already seen, offered
 * as a proposal rather than shipped as a fait accompli. The user accepts or
 * rejects it in place; the outcome rides the action channel lf-board opened, and
 * the next version carries the settled markup.
 *
 * Deciding is the end of the matter on screen: the element settles to the
 * surviving slot there and then (the theme drops every mark from it), exactly as a
 * dragged card sits where it was dropped before the honoring version exists —
 * the live view is the version plus the user's actions replayed on it. So
 * applyAction states an absolute outcome, which makes a reload, a second tab,
 * and the sender itself all converge on the same view. A pick can be cleared by
 * clicking its mark again; a decision can't. Changing your mind is a comment,
 * and the version reverses it.
 *
 * What deciding must not be is the page rearranging itself under the hand that
 * pressed. It was both. A block change is a struck old paragraph over a tinted
 * new one, so accepting took 179 measured pixels out of the middle of the page in
 * one frame, and everything below jumped up under the pointer; and the row the
 * user had just pressed cleared itself in the same frame, leaving a corner toast
 * as the only evidence that anything had been done at all. Two rules answer it,
 * both of them already written down. Where something has to move it moves as
 * motion, so the retired slot folds over a fifth of a second and the eye follows
 * the sentence to where it went. And the pressed control's own line holds still:
 * the row stays, the control the user pressed says what it did ("✓ Accepted"),
 * and its pair goes without giving up its room. The rail is reserved for the
 * page's life whether or not any row is left in it, so the standing record costs
 * nothing that was going to be reclaimed — and a reader who looks back at the
 * margin can see which changes they took.
 *
 * The word a decision leaves behind has its room from the start: a control that
 * took the room for two more glyphs at the moment it was pressed would move its
 * neighbour on the one line where nothing may. Each control reserves the width of
 * its own decided word as the row is built (reserve), measured in the control's
 * live face rather than stated as a number, so the reservation re-measures itself
 * when the font moves — and the one table below is what the controls write and
 * what they reserve, so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * Placement: the controls hang in the theme's rail, off the column's right edge,
 * on the line the change starts. Two elements say that, because one box cannot.
 * The row is the column's own child, inserted after the block the change sits
 * in: `left: 100%` is the page margin only where the column is the containing
 * block, and inside a positioned widget — a board card — it is that card's edge,
 * which no measurement can undo. Its line comes from a CSS anchor, an empty span
 * the widget prepends to itself and the row names: `top: anchor(top)` is the line
 * that span sits on, mid-sentence included, and the page reflows underneath with
 * both riding along. Hoisted, the row still meets the reader and the tab order
 * beside the change it decides, because it follows that change's own block.
 *
 * That margin is the theme's rail, reserved by a page that carries a row at all;
 * measuring is what finds it, not what makes it. Three things are measured, all by
 * one observer serving every suggestion on the page: whether the change is on
 * screen — one inside a collapsed container (a closed <details>, a tab that isn't
 * showing) has no line to hang on, and its row waits, hidden, for the reflow that
 * opens it; whether the page is wide enough to hold the row beside the column
 * (below the rail's breakpoint it keeps its whole width, and an open comment panel
 * takes the rest), where it isn't the row docks into flow where it was hoisted to,
 * a control line under the block it follows; and whether two rows land on top of
 * each other, which a translate nudges apart without touching layout. */
