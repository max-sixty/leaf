"""What only a browser can see: that a page actually renders.

check is static — it parses the file and validates the vocabulary. Everything
downstream of that (a widget's upgrade, the theme's CSS, the runtime's injected
chrome) meets for the first time in the browser, and the failures that live
there are invisible to a linter. This suite drives the shipped examples through
the Chrome already on the machine and asserts the handful of things that were
each, at some point, wrong:

  - a widget that upgrades into a box of no size (cq-tabs marked itself with a
    class the runtime's chrome had already claimed for its visually-hidden live
    region, so every tabbed page rendered blank below the lede);
  - the document and the comment panel scrolling in one region, which stacks two
    scrollbars in the same few pixels at the window's right edge;
  - a text box sized by script, which had to shrink itself to re-measure and so
    flashed a scrollbar on every keystroke;
  - the passage under the open composer going unmarked, because focusing the box
    drops the browser's own selection and nothing drew it back.

One journey test walks the loop the product is — select a passage, comment on
it, drag a card, follow the next version, and find the comment still anchored —
and asserts the event log those gestures leave behind. The log is the trail
Claude actually reads, so it is the artifact worth pinning; the DOM along the
way is checked only where a step depends on it.

Chrome is driven through Playwright's `channel="chrome"`, which attaches to the
installed browser: no download, no build step, `uv` still the one prerequisite.

    out perfectly well on its own; it is the two states together that say anything.

    Two of the three are fixed by holding the widest word's room from the start. That
    room is measured at load rather than stated, because a number read once out of a
    browser covers the face it was read in and no other: the pick column's stood at 68px
    and went 2px short the first time this ran on Linux, whose system sans sets "your
    pick" wider than macOS's. This is what said so, and it says how late a stated number
    is caught — a platform late, and only where there is a second platform to run on.

    Driven over the corpus rather than per widget: a control this sweep has never heard
    of joins it by being pressable, which is the only property it reads.

    One press per page, because a press is a gesture made on the page as published and
    the state an earlier one leaves changes what a later one proves. Pressing straight
    down the document hid the sign-off button's 12px for exactly that reason: Comments
    comes first in the banner, and with the panel open the row is crowded enough that

    """The other half of the same rule, for the changes nobody asked for.

    A press has a line — the row the pressed control stands on, where the next gesture
    is already aimed — and below it the page is content and may move. News arriving on
    the poll has no gesture at all, so there is no line to draw: the user was
    somewhere else entirely, and every control in the chrome is an address they are
    holding. The document may still change under them, because a fact arriving is what
    they are here to see; the address it arrives at may not.

    The banner is where all of it lands, and it is packed to the right against a spacer,
    which decides who pays. A control that grows moves itself and everything to its
    *left*; everything to its right keeps its place. So `Comments (9)` becoming
    `Comments (10)` — a comment posted from the terminal while the user reads —
    slid the version chooser 6px left, and the ✓ Accept all a second tab's decision puts
    away took the New-version chip with it.

    Driven by writing the events a real one would leave, since that is what the page

    """How many a group takes is the one thing about it a reader has to know before
    pressing anything, and for a while the page said it nowhere. A `multiple` group drew
    the identical circles a single-pick group draws — the shape every platform uses for
    "one of these" — so the two questions were pixel-for-pixel the same and the only
    thing that distinguished them was the author remembering to say so in prose. A reader
    who took the marks at their word would pick once and expect the next click to replace
    it.

    So the mark carries the arity, in both of the registers one control has: its corner
    is round for one and square for any, and its word is "choose one" or "choose any" for
    a reader who gets no corner. The corner is read as a fraction of the mark's own box,
    because the two are computed in different units (a circle is stated as a percentage of
    a box whose size is stated in px) and the question is the shape rather than either
    number. What is pinned is that they differ and that the single-pick one is a full
    round — a threshold between them would be this design's 3px corner written down a
    second time, free to disagree with it.

    Arity is not the form, which is why the contrast is card against card. Both of the
    rules here were the list form's once, on the reading that a `multiple` group is a
    list of slots; `multiple` is orthogonal to which form a group takes, so a titled
    group asking "which of these" inherited neither and offered the reader nothing to
    count. Hence the second half: an unticked box is a fact about that option, not the
    group's offer said again, so it draws under `multiple` where a single-pick card —
    whose state has the whole cell to live in — gives it up.

    reply that quotes it back. So the pointer path grows a selection out to word
    boundaries, outward only: an end resting in space or against punctuation is
    already where the reader put it, so "it," gains its 't' and not its comma, and a
    word split across inline markup — here by splitText, which also leaves the empty

    grown — shift-arrow is the reader being precise — so the key release that raises
    the button leaves a mid-word selection exactly as made, and so does the right
    button, whose release precedes the context menu Copy lives in. A right-to-left
    drag keeps its direction, asked of boundary points rather than node order because
    a selection ending on the element holding its own start both precedes and
    contains it. And machine-placed words never glue to the author's, on either

    The box: reading and editing are the same box, so the words a user
    double-clicked are still under the pointer when the editor opens. They were
    not — the runtime's general textarea rule wraps text in padding and a border
    and floors it at 64px, which moved the first character 9px right and 6px down
    and stretched a two-line draft — and text that jumps out from under a
    double-click is the user's aim thrown away.

    The gesture: the word the browser would select is selected by the second
    mousedown and painted before dblclick arrives, so the handler that cleared it
    afterwards ran a frame late and the user saw a flash. That frame is
    timing, and no assertion here reaches it; what is assertable is the outcome
    on either side of it. Nothing on the page ends up selected, and the word the
    gesture named opens selected in the box — which is what a double-click means
    everywhere else, and what cancelling the default rather than undoing it is
    for.

    The block around them counts too: the whole draft has to keep its shape, or a
    gesture aimed at one word is answered by everything under it moving. Cancel and
    Save join a row the draft always has rather than arriving as one, which is worth
    a measurement because the row is invisible in the diff that matters — both views
    lay out fine on their own, and only the two together say whether the box moved.

    And the swap is the screen's, which is why the widget writes none of it: paper
    drops the box with the other offers, so a draft mid-edit printed as an empty

    """The copy is the page as replay left it, and a report is replay's other
    channel — none of the corpus can say so, because an example is one version
    with an empty log. The caught-up wait counts reports beside actions, as the
    render gate does; what this run can prove of that is the overcount
    direction, a wait that would hang on a number the stamp never reaches. The
    undercount — a report-only page copied before its first poll painted —
    outruns even a held `/api/state`, since export's own networkidle waits that
    poll out; only a machine slow enough to open the gap between the last
    resource and the first poll reaches it, and the loaded-machine sweep's
