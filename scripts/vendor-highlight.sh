# Rebuild skills/leaf/assets/vendor/highlight.esm.js.
#
# Unlike mermaid and Sortable, upstream ships no browser-native ESM build: the
# `es/` directory re-exports CommonJS and only resolves through a bundler. So the
# vendored file is one we produce — core plus exactly the languages the registry
# enumerates, bundled to ESM and minified. Each language registers under
# leaf's own name (`html`, not hljs's `xml`), so the page's vocabulary and
# the tokenizer's cannot drift: `language="html"` either resolves or the bundle was
# built from a different list than the registry states.
#
# The language list is not stated here: it is read out of registry.json's
# `$languages.names`, which is the list `version check` refuses an unknown language against
# and the list an agent queries while authoring. One list, so the bundle cannot offer a
# language the lint rejects or lack one it accepts. Add a language there, then rerun
# this.
