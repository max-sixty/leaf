"""Record docs/demo.gif, and the landing page's two session stills, by driving the
shipped runtime through one round.

The stills used to be shot by hand, which meant nothing regenerated them and nothing
noticed when they stopped being true: a theme change left the landing page arguing for
a product whose picture showed the previous one. They come off the same staged scene as
the GIF because that scene is already the one the page's alt text describes — a comment
anchored to a marked passage, Claude's reply in the thread, v2 latest in the picker —
so shooting them here costs two more browser contexts and gives them something to
re-run."""

    `--output` redirects the whole recording, and the stills have to go with it: the
    suite records into a tmp directory to prove the journey still drives, and stills
    that ignored the flag rewrote docs/session-{light,dark}.png on every run of the
    tests. A test that leaves the working tree dirty is one whose next reader has to
    work out whether the diff is theirs.

    reply, v2 published, the state back to waiting — so a fresh context loading the
    page arrives at exactly the picture docs/index.html describes in its alt text.
    Fresh is the point: the panel's open state lives in localStorage, so a reused
    context would restore whatever the last gesture left rather than the shot's own
    setup.

    One shot per color scheme, because the page states both and the landing page
    serves whichever the reader's OS asks for. A scheme is a context-level setting,
    not something to toggle on a live page: the vendored diagram palette is read once
    at load, so a flipped page would carry the other scheme's diagrams.

    Getting the banner to say "Claude awaits" takes stating both halves of it.
    `record` has received and acknowledged the board action through the waiter it
